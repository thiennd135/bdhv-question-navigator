## ‚ú® What does it do?

Tired of scrubbing through long course videos just to find the quiz questions? This script is for you! It automatically detects questions in your Binh Dan Hoc Vu So videos and pops up a neat little control panel. From there, you can see all the questions listed with their timestamps and jump directly to any of them with a single click. No more guessing or wasting time.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these three steps to get the script running.

### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

If you don't have one, install **Tampermonkey** (recommended) from your browser's extension store:

* [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
* [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
* [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

### Step 2: ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable Userscript Execution (For Chrome/Edge Users)

Due to recent changes in Chrome, you need to give Tampermonkey explicit permission to run userscripts. You only need to do this once.

1.  Right-click the **Tampermonkey icon** in your browser's toolbar.
2.  Select **"Manage Extension"**.
3.  Find and turn on the toggle for **"Allow User Scripts"**.

*(If you don't see this toggle, you can enable "Developer Mode" on the same `chrome://extensions` page as an alternative.)*

### Step 3: Install the Script

Click the link below. Tampermonkey will open a new tab asking you to confirm. Just click the **`Install`** button.
